Since its beginning in 2013, Black Lives Matter has worked towards equality and focused mainly on defending victims of police brutality. Although Black people only account for about 13% of the US population, they account for 28% of the cases of those killed by police. According to mappingpoliceviolence.org, Black people are less likely than white people to be carrying a weapon, but 3 times as likely to be killed by police. Even more terrifying is the fact that 99% of police officers who murder innocent Black people are never charged with committing a crime. These statistics are horrifying, but the Black Lives Matter movement and other similar organizations are working hard to promote lasting change in our country.  "
